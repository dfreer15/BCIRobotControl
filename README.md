# BCIRobotControl

Hello, this repository houses a framework for EEG Motor Imagery control of an assistive robotic manipulator. 
The framework uses simple computer vision techniques along with EEG processing to control a simulated robot in 3-dimensional space.

The simulation environment we have used is V-REP, so for instructions on how to install this and use the remote API, check out their website: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/

We have also used LabStreamingLayer to facilitate the movement of EEG data between different programs. For more information about this, their open source code is also available: https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer
